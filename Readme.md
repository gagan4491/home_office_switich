# VPN Setup and Management for Mac

This repository contains scripts and configuration files for setting up and managing a VPN connection on a Mac system. Below is a breakdown of each file and its purpose.

## Files

1. **VPN Setup for Mac**
   - **File**: `vpn_setup_for_mac.pdf`
   - **Description**: This file contains the instructions and necessary commands to install and configure the necessary software for the VPN. It includes installation of `openfortivpn`, `expect`, and other dependencies.

2. **Shell Scripts**
   - **File**: `shell_scripts_to_add.pdf`
   - **Description**: A collection of Bash and Expect scripts to manage VPN connections and configure network settings dynamically based on the IP address and network interface.
     - `Masq.sh`: Applies iptables rules for the VPN.
     - `Login.sh`: Handles the login process for the VPN using `expect` to automate interactions.
     - `Run.sh`: Orchestrates the execution of other scripts, sets up DNS, and manages screen sessions.
     - `For office.sh` & `For home.sh`: Adds necessary routes for office and home networks.
     - `Check_ip.sh`: Determines the correct script to run based on the subnet of the current IP address.
     - `Check_ppp0.sh`: Determines that  run.sh is running its course 
     
3. **Crontab Configuration**
   - **File**: `crontab.pdf`
   - **Description**: Contains crontab entries to automate script executions based on the system's IP address, ensuring VPN routes are correctly managed upon system reboots and at specific times.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Installing Dependencies**: Follow the commands listed in `vpn_setup_for_mac.pdf` to install all required software.

2. **Configuring Scripts**: Review and deploy the scripts from `shell_scripts_to_add.pdf`. Ensure all paths and permissions are correctly set to allow execution.

3. **Scheduling Tasks**: Update your crontab using the entries provided in `crontab.pdf` to automate the running of scripts at reboot or specific times.

## Usage

After installation and configuration, the system will automatically adjust VPN settings based on network changes and ensure connectivity across reboots and network switches.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure all paths in scripts and crontab entries are correct. Verify that all necessary permissions are granted to execute the scripts.

## Additional Notes

These files are tailored for a Mac environment and use specific tools available on Unix-like systems. Make sure to adjust the scripts if you are using a different environment or require different configurations.
